        <p>The eight-pointed star, shown in the figure below, is a popular quilting pattern. What percent of the entire $4\times4$ grid is covered by the star?</p>

    <div class="solution" id="Q1Sol" hidden="true">
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>There is symmetry, and so whatever fraction of the top-left quarter is shaded, is the same as the fraction of the entire square that is shaded.</p>
        <p>Focus on the top-left quarter. Consider moving a single triangle. The shaded area in the problem is exactly the same as the shaded area in this diagram (and the top-left quarter is outlined in bold):</p>
        <img src="Assets/Images/1-sol.svg">
        <p>But then it is obvious that exactly half of the top-left quarter is shaded, and so the answer is 50% which is choice <b>B.</b></p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Each of the unshaded triangles has base length $2$ and height $1$, so they all have area $\frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 1$. Each of the unshaded unit squares has area $1$. The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded region, or $4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1 = 8$. The star is then $\frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{50}{100}$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of the entire grid. </p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>There are $16$ total squares in the diagram and each square has $2$ triangles whose areas are half the area of a unit square. Thus, the total number of triangles in the diagram is $4^2 \cdot 2 = 32$ triangles. There are $16$ shaded triangles in the diagram, so the area of the star is $\dfrac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{50}{100}$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent.</p>
        <h3>Solution 4</h3>
        <p>There are $4$ squares that are entirely shaded and $4$ squares that have no shading. This cancels them out. The rest of the squares are half-half. Therefore the shaded region is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of the grid.</p>
        <h3>Solution 5</h3>
        <p>Note that we can move one triangle from each of the four cells in the middle to each of the four corners. This will leave every cell in the grid with one triangle each, and each triangle has an area of half the area of each cell. Thus, our answer must equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, and so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}.$</p>
        <h3>Solution 6</h3>
        <p>The shaded area is a $2 \times 2$ square in the middle of the figure combined with $8$ small triangles. Since each small triangle is $\frac{1}{2}$ of a unit square, the star's area is equal to the area of $4 + 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 8$ unit squares, which $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of the grid.</p>
        <h3>Solution 7</h3>
        <p>You can move the extra half a squares and make 4 squares so there are 8/16. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of 16.</p>

        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>We just need to count how many of each type of glyph there are.</p>
        <p>There is 1 glyph worth 10,000.</p>
        <p>There are 4 glyphs worth 100 each.</p>
        <p>There are 2 glyphs worth 10 each.</p>
        <p>There are 3 glyphs worth 1 each.</p>
        <p>So, the answer is 10,423, which is choice <b>B.</b></p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>The first hieroglyph is worth $10,000$, the next 4 are worth $100 \cdot 4 = 400$, the next $2$ are worth $10 \cdot 2 = 20$, and the last $3$ are worth $1 \cdot 3 = 3$. Therefore, the answer is $10,000 + 400 + 20 + 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>Simply notice that the first hieroglyph represents $10,000$, and the next ones represent $4$ hundreds. The only answer choice with a $1$ in the thousands place and a $4$ in the hundreds place is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 4</h3>
        <p>From a first inspection, you may notice that there is no thousands hieroglyph. The only option with zero in the thousands place is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$</p>

        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>We start with Annika and $3$ of her friends playing, meaning that there are $4$ players. This must mean that there is a total of $4 \cdot 15 = 60$ cards. If $2$ more players joined, there would be $6$ players, and since the cards need to be split evenly, this would mean that each player gets $\frac{60}{6}=\boxed{\text{(C) 10}}$ Buffalo Shuffle-O cards each meaning that the final answer is 10.</p>

        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Since we want to find the $9$th number Lucius says after he says $100$, $7$ is subtracted from his number $9$ times, so our answer is $100-(9 \cdot 7) = \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>Using brute force and counting backward by $7$s, we have $100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65, 58, 51, 44, \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$.</p>
        <p>Note that this solution is not practical and very time-consuming.</p>
        <h3>Solution 4</h3>
        <p>This can be thought of as an arithmetic sequence. Knowing that our first term is $100$, we have to add $7$ to get to our 0th term, $107$. Our answer is then $107 - 10 \cdot 7 = \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$.</p>

        <p>Each of the $6$ faces of the cube have equal area, so the area of each face is equal to $\frac{18}{6} = 3$, making the side length $\sqrt3$. From this, we can see that the volume of the cube is $\sqrt{3}^3 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}3\sqrt{3}}$.</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Let the side length of the cube shown be equal to $s$ centimeters. The surface area of this cube is equal to the area of the net of the cube, which is equal to $18$ square centimeters. The surface area of this cube is also $6s^2$ square centimeters, so we have\[6s^2 = 18 \implies s^2 = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \implies s = \sqrt{3}.\]However, we aren't done. We have found that the side length of the cube is $\sqrt{3} cm$, but the question asks for the volume of the cube, which is equal to $s^3 = \sqrt{3}^3 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}3\sqrt{3}}$ cubic centimeters.</p>

        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>Our answer is\[\frac{\frac{1+7}{2} + \frac{2+8}{2} + \cdots + \frac{6+12}{2}}{6} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}((1+7)+(2+8)+\cdots+(6+12))}{6} = \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{78}{12} =\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}\]</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>We proceed with brute force. All of the pairs of opposite numbers on the clock are $(12,6)$, $(1,7)$, $(2,8)$, $(3,9)$, $(4,10)$, $(5,11)$, where order doesn't matter. The averages of each of these pairs are $9, 4, 5, 6, 7,$ and $8$ respectively, and the average these numbers is $\frac{9+4+5+6+7+8}{6}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>The problem is asking for the average of all $12$ numbers. To find the average of all $12$ numbers, you find the sum of all the integers from $1$ to $12$ which is $78$, and divide it by $12$ because there are 12 terms. Therefore, the answer is $\frac{78}{12}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$. You could also see that the average of, $2$ and $8$, is $5$, only one more that it's consecutive pair, $1$ and $7$ which is $4$. Assuming that this is the pattern, we can find the average $4$ to $9$ (6 consecutive integers starting with $4$), and we that find our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$.</p>

        <p>The area of each rectangle is $5 \cdot 3 = 15$. Then the sum of the areas of the two regions is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles, minus the area of their overlap. To find the area of the overlap, we note that the region of overlap is a square, each of whose sides have length $2.5$ (as they are formed by the midpoint of one of the long sides, the vertex, and also, since it is rotated 90 degrees). Then the answer is $15+15-2.5^2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~23.75}$.</p>

        <p>The largest circle that can fit inside the figure has its center in the middle of the figure and will be tangent to the figure in $8$ points. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from the center to one of these $8$ points is $\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt5$, so the area of this circle is $\pi \sqrt{5}^2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 5\pi}$.</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Draw the circle in the grid and analyze the radius. Its radius is a little more than 2 but a lot less than 2.5, so the area is a little more than 4π. So, the area of the circle is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 5\pi}$ with a radius of approximately 2.23.</p>

    <div class="solution" id="Q13Sol" hidden="true">
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>Let's take the numbers 2 through 14 (evens). The remainders will be 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, and 0. This sequence keeps repeating itself over and over. We can take $\left\lfloor\frac{50}{14}\right\rfloor$, so after the number 42, every remainder has been achieved 3 times. However, since 44, 46, 48, and 50 are left, the remainders of those will be 2, 4, 6, and 1 respectively. The only histogram in which those 4 numbers are set at 4 is histogram $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Writing down all the remainders gives us $2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1.$ In this list, there are $3$ numbers with remainder $0$, $4$ numbers with remainder $1$, $4$ numbers with remainder $2$, $3$ numbers with remainder $3$, $4$ numbers with remainder $4$, $3$ numbers with remainder $5$, and $4$ numbers with remainder $6$. Manually computation of every single term can be avoided by recognizing the pattern alternates from $0, 2, 4, 6$ to $1, 3, 5$ and there are $25$ terms. The only histogram that matches this is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.</p>

    <div class="solution" id="Q14Sol" hidden="true">
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>The median of the list is $7$, so the mean of the new list will be $7 \cdot 2 = 14$. Since there are $6$ numbers in the new list, the sum of the $6$ numbers will be $14 \cdot 6 = 84$. Therefore, $2+6+7+7+28+N = 84 \implies N = \boxed{\text{(E)\ 34}}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Since the average right now is $10$, and the median is $7$, we see that $N$ must be larger than $10$, which means that the median of the 6 resulting numbers should be $7$, making the mean of these $14$. We can do $2 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 28 + N = 14 * 6 = 84$. $50 + N = 84$, so $N$ = $\boxed{\text{(E)\ 34}}$</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>We try out every option by inserting each number into the list. After trying out each number, we get $\boxed{\text{(E)\ 34}}$</p>
        <p>Note that this is very time-consuming and it is not the most practical solution.</p>
        <h3>Solution 4</h3>
        <p>We could use answer choices to solve this problem. The sum of the $5$ numbers is $50$. If you add $7$ to the list, $57$ is not divisible by $6$, therefore it will not work. Same thing applies to $14$ and $20$. The only possible choices left are $28$ and $34$. Now you check $28$. You see that $28$ doesn't work because $(28+50) \div 6 = 13$ and $13$ is not twice of the median, which is still $7$. Therefore, only choice left is $\boxed{\text{(E)\ 34}}$</p>
