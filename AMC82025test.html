      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        There is symmetry, and so whatever fraction of the top-left quarter is
        shaded, is the same as the fraction of the entire square that is shaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus on the top-left quarter. Consider moving a single triangle. The
        shaded area in the problem is exactly the same as the shaded area in
        this diagram (and the top-left quarter is outlined in bold):
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/Images/1-sol.svg" />
      <p>
        But then it is obvious that exactly half of the top-left quarter is
        shaded, and so the answer is 50% which is choice <b>B.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Each of the unshaded triangles has base length $2$ and height $1$, so
        they all have area $\frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 1$. Each of the unshaded unit
        squares has area $1$. The area of the shaded region is equal to the area
        of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded region, or $4^2 - 4
        \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1 = 8$. The star is then $\frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2} =
        \frac{50}{100}$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of the entire
        grid.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        There are $16$ total squares in the diagram and each square has $2$
        triangles whose areas are half the area of a unit square. Thus, the
        total number of triangles in the diagram is $4^2 \cdot 2 = 32$
        triangles. There are $16$ shaded triangles in the diagram, so the area
        of the star is $\dfrac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{50}{100}$, or
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        There are $4$ squares that are entirely shaded and $4$ squares that have
        no shading. This cancels them out. The rest of the squares are
        half-half. Therefore the shaded region is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$
        percent of the grid.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 5</h3>
      <p>
        Note that we can move one triangle from each of the four cells in the
        middle to each of the four corners. This will leave every cell in the
        grid with one triangle each, and each triangle has an area of half the
        area of each cell. Thus, our answer must equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, and so
        our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}.$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 6</h3>
      <p>
        The shaded area is a $2 \times 2$ square in the middle of the figure
        combined with $8$ small triangles. Since each small triangle is
        $\frac{1}{2}$ of a unit square, the star's area is equal to the area of
        $4 + 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 8$ unit squares, which
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of the grid.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 7</h3>
      <p>
        You can move the extra half a squares and make 4 squares so there are
        8/16. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~50}$ percent of 16.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>We just need to count how many of each type of glyph there are.</p>
      <p>There is 1 glyph worth 10,000.</p>
      <p>There are 4 glyphs worth 100 each.</p>
      <p>There are 2 glyphs worth 10 each.</p>
      <p>There are 3 glyphs worth 1 each.</p>
      <p>So, the answer is 10,423, which is choice <b>B.</b></p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        The first hieroglyph is worth $10,000$, the next 4 are worth $100 \cdot
        4 = 400$, the next $2$ are worth $10 \cdot 2 = 20$, and the last $3$ are
        worth $1 \cdot 3 = 3$. Therefore, the answer is $10,000 + 400 + 20 + 3 =
        \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Simply notice that the first hieroglyph represents $10,000$, and the
        next ones represent $4$ hundreds. The only answer choice with a $1$ in
        the thousands place and a $4$ in the hundreds place is answer choice
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        From a first inspection, you may notice that there is no thousands
        hieroglyph. The only option with zero in the thousands place is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        We start with Annika and $3$ of her friends playing, meaning that there
        are $4$ players. This must mean that there is a total of $4 \cdot 15 =
        60$ cards. If $2$ more players joined, there would be $6$ players, and
        since the cards need to be split evenly, this would mean that each
        player gets $\frac{60}{6}=\boxed{\text{(C) 10}}$ Buffalo Shuffle-O cards
        each meaning that the final answer is 10.

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        We plug $a=100, d=-7$ and $n=10$ into the formula $a+d(n-1)$ for the
        $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a$ and common
        difference is $d$ to get $100-7(10-1) = \boxed{\text{(B) 37}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Since we want to find the $9$th number Lucius says after he says $100$,
        $7$ is subtracted from his number $9$ times, so our answer is $100-(9
        \cdot 7) = \boxed{\text{(B) 37}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Using brute force and counting backward by $7$s, we have $100, 93, 86,
        79, 72, 65, 58, 51, 44, \boxed{\text{(B) 37}}$.
      </p>
      <p>Note that this solution is not practical and very time-consuming.</p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        This can be thought of as an arithmetic sequence. Knowing that our first
        term is $100$, we have to add $7$ to get to our 0th term, $107$. Our
        answer is then $107 - 10 \cdot 7 = \boxed{\text{(B) 37}}$.

        The sum of all five numbers is $85$. Since $85$ is $1$ more than a

        The sum of the residues of these numbers modulo $4$ is $-1+0+1+2+3=5

        $50$ people scored at least $80\%$, and out of these $50$ people, $13$
        of them earned a score that was not less than $90\%$, so the number of
        people that scored in between at least $80\%$ and less than $90\%$ is
        $50-13 = \boxed{\text{(D) 37}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Let $a$ denote the number of people who had a score of at least $85$,
        but less than $90$, and let $b$ denote the number of people who had a
        score of at least $80$ but less than $85$. Our answer is equal to $a+b$.
        We find $a = 27 - 13 = 14$, while $b = 50 - 27 = 23$. Thus, the answer
        is $23 + 14 = \boxed{\text{(D) 37}}$.

        Each of the $6$ faces of the cube have equal area, so the area of each
        face is equal to $\frac{18}{6} = 3$, making the side length $\sqrt3$.
        From this, we can see that the volume of the cube is $\sqrt{3}^3 =

        Let the side length of the cube shown be equal to $s$ centimeters. The

        which is equal to $18$ square centimeters. The surface area of this cube
        is also $6s^2$ square centimeters, so we have\[6s^2 = 18 \implies s^2 =
        \frac{18}{6} = 3 \implies s = \sqrt{3}.\]However, we aren't done. We
        have found that the side length of the cube is $\sqrt{3} cm$, but the
        question asks for the volume of the cube, which is equal to $s^3 =

        Our answer is\[\frac{\frac{1+7}{2} + \frac{2+8}{2} + \cdots +
        \frac{6+12}{2}}{6} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}((1+7)+(2+8)+\cdots+(6+12))}{6} =

      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        We proceed with brute force. All of the pairs of opposite numbers on the
        clock are $(12,6)$, $(1,7)$, $(2,8)$, $(3,9)$, $(4,10)$, $(5,11)$, where
        order doesn't matter. The averages of each of these pairs are $9, 4, 5,
        6, 7,$ and $8$ respectively, and the average these numbers is
        $\frac{9+4+5+6+7+8}{6}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        The problem is asking for the average of all $12$ numbers. To find the
        average of all $12$ numbers, you find the sum of all the integers from
        $1$ to $12$ which is $78$, and divide it by $12$ because there are 12
        terms. Therefore, the answer is
        $\frac{78}{12}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$. You could also see that the
        average of, $2$ and $8$, is $5$, only one more that it's consecutive
        pair, $1$ and $7$ which is $4$. Assuming that this is the pattern, we
        can find the average $4$ to $9$ (6 consecutive integers starting with
        $4$), and we that find our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$.

        The area of each rectangle is $5 \cdot 3 = 15$. Then the sum of the
        areas of the two regions is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles,
        minus the area of their overlap. To find the area of the overlap, we
        note that the region of overlap is a square, each of whose sides have
        length $2.5$ (as they are formed by the midpoint of one of the long
        sides, the vertex, and also, since it is rotated 90 degrees). Then the
        answer is $15+15-2.5^2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~23.75}$.

        As you can see, there is a hole in the top left corner of the board,
        which would be impossible to fill using the tetrominos. There are three
        cases in which a hole isn't created; the S lies flat in the bottom left

        For each of the inverted cases, the L pieces can be inverted along with
        the S piece. Because the only cases that fill the rectangle after the S

        The largest circle that can fit inside the figure has its center in the

        the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from the center to one of these

        Draw the circle in the grid and analyze the radius. Its radius is a

        Let's take the numbers 2 through 14 (evens). The remainders will be 2,
        4, 6, 1, 3, 5, and 0. This sequence keeps repeating itself over and
        over. We can take $\left\lfloor\frac{50}{14}\right\rfloor$, so after the
        number 42, every remainder has been achieved 3 times. However, since 44,
        46, 48, and 50 are left, the remainders of those will be 2, 4, 6, and 1
        respectively. The only histogram in which those 4 numbers are set at 4
        is histogram $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Writing down all the remainders gives us $2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6,
        1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1.$ In this list, there are
        $3$ numbers with remainder $0$, $4$ numbers with remainder $1$, $4$
        numbers with remainder $2$, $3$ numbers with remainder $3$, $4$ numbers
        with remainder $4$, $3$ numbers with remainder $5$, and $4$ numbers with
        remainder $6$. Manually computation of every single term can be avoided
        by recognizing the pattern alternates from $0, 2, 4, 6$ to $1, 3, 5$ and
        there are $25$ terms. The only histogram that matches this is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        The median of the list is $7$, so the mean of the new list will be $7
        \cdot 2 = 14$. Since there are $6$ numbers in the new list, the sum of
        the $6$ numbers will be $14 \cdot 6 = 84$. Therefore, $2+6+7+7+28+N = 84
        \implies N = \boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Since the average right now is $10$, and the median is $7$, we see that
        $N$ must be larger than $10$, which means that the median of the 6
        resulting numbers should be $7$, making the mean of these $14$. We can
        do $2 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 28 + N = 14 * 6 = 84$. $50 + N = 84$, so $N$ =
        $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        We try out every option by inserting each number into the list. After
        trying out each number, we get $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this is very time-consuming and it is not the most practical
        solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        We could use answer choices to solve this problem. The sum of the $5$
        numbers is $50$. If you add $7$ to the list, $57$ is not divisible by
        $6$, therefore it will not work. Same thing applies to $14$ and $20$.
        The only possible choices left are $28$ and $34$. Now you check $28$.
        You see that $28$ doesn't work because $(28+50) \div 6 = 13$ and $13$ is
        not twice of the median, which is still $7$. Therefore, only choice left
        is $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        First, we note that there are $18$ "pairs" of squares folded on top of
        each other after the folding. The minimum number of gold pairs occurs
        when silver squares occupy the maximum number of pairs, and the maximum
        number of gold pairs occurs when silver squares occupy the minimum
        number of pairs. The latter case occurs when all $13$ silver squares are
        placed in different pairs, resulting in $18-13=5$ gold pairs. The former
        case occurs when the silver squares are paired up as much as possible,
        resulting in $6$ complete pairs and another square occupying another
        pair slot. Then there are $18-7=11$ gold pairs. Our answer is
        $11+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        We can see that the least number of gold-on-gold pairs will be obtained
        when the $13$ silver squares are placed on the two sides so that they
        don't overlap when folded over (because then it will minimize the number
        of gold-on-golds). We can see that if we split them up $6$ and $7$ on
        both sides, and then fold it, the number of gold-on-golds will be $18-13
        = 5$.
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum number of gold-on-golds will be achieved when the silver
        squares overlap when folded over, which will increase the number of
        gold-on-golds. If we align 6 silver squares with each other on each
        side, and put the last one somewhere else, we get the maximum is $18 - 7
        = 11$. Therefore, the answer is $11+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~16}$.

      <p>
        Note that for no two numbers to differ by $10$, every number chosen must
        have a different units digit. To make computations easier, we can choose
        $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ from the first group and $(16, 17, 18, 19, 20)$ from
        the second group. Then the sum evaluates to $1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20 =
        \boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        For $1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20$, we can add the first term and the last
        term, which is $21$. If we add the second term and the second-to-last
        term it is also $21$. There are $5$ pairs that sum to $21$, so the
        answer is $21 \times 5$ which equals $\boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        One efficient method is to quickly add $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
        10)$, which is $55$. Then because you took $50$ in total away from $(16,
        17, 18, 19, 20)$, you add $50$. $55+50= \boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I started with the easiest/smallest case
        possible. In my opinion, that was
        <br />$1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20$.<br />
        I then solved this equation quickly using Little Gauss's method,
        rearranging that into <br />$1+19+2+18+3+17+4+16+5+20$.<br />
        I simplified this into <br />$20+20+20+20+25$.<br />
        Solving this simple equation gives us the answer, which is
        $\boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.

        We could also make an equation. Let's denote the number of people that

        number of people working in city $A$, then $x = \frac{1}{8}c +
        \frac{1}{3}b + a - \frac{1}{4}a - \frac{1}{5}a$. This is because
        $\frac{1}{8}$ of the people from City $C$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ of the
        people from City $B$ work in city $A$ as shown in the image. We also

        cities. We are already given the values of variables $a$, $b$, and $c$
        as $100$, $120$, and $160$ respectively. Plug the values it into the

      <p>
        The area of the shaded region in the circle on the left is the area of
        the circle minus the area of the square, or $\big(\pi-2)$. The shaded
        area in the circle on the right is $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the area of the
        circle minus the area of the square, or $\dfrac{\pi R^2-2R^2}{4}$, which
        can be factored as $\dfrac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$. Since the shaded areas are
        equal to each other, we have $\pi-2=\dfrac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$, which
        simplifies to $R^2=4$. Taking the square root, we have
        $R=\boxed{\text{(B)\ 2}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        The side length of the smaller square is $\sqrt{2}$, which follows from
        the Pythagorean Theorem since the square is inscribed in a circle of
        radius $1$, making the diagonal equal to $2$. Thus, the area of the
        square is $(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$. The circle in which the square is
        inscribed has radius $1$, so its area is $\pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi$.
        Therefore, the area of the shaded region (the part of the circle not
        covered by the square) is $\pi - 2$.<br />

        Now, consider the larger square, which is inscribed in a circle of
        radius $R$. This square can be divided into four congruent right
        triangles by drawing lines from the center of the circle to the vertices
        of the square. Each triangle has legs of length $R$ and includes a
        $90^\circ$ angle at the center. Using the triangle area formula
        $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C)$ with $a = b = R$ and $C = 90^\circ$, each
        triangle has area $\frac{1}{2}R^2$. Since there are four such triangles,
        the area of the square is $4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}R^2 = 2R^2$. The area of
        the circle is $\pi R^2$, so the area of the shaded region (the part of
        the circle outside the square) is $\frac{1}{4}(\pi R^2 - 2R^2) =
        \frac{1}{4}R^2(\pi - 2)$.<br />

        We are told that this shaded region also has area equal to $\pi - 2$, so
        we set up the equation $\frac{1}{4}R^2(\pi - 2) = \pi - 2$. Assuming
        $\pi - 2 \neq 0$, we divide both sides by $\pi - 2$, giving
        $\frac{1}{4}R^2 = 1$, which leads to $R^2 = 4$, and finally $R = 2$.
        Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) } 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        We start with the first area. Since the square is inscribed, its
        diagonal is $2\implies$ its side length is $\sqrt{2}\implies$ its area
        is $2$, therefore the first area is $\pi-2$. The second area is
        $\dfrac{R^2\pi-2R^2}{4}$, found in a similar manner. Writing and solving
        the equation, we
        have\[\pi-2=\dfrac{R^2\pi-2R^2}{4}\implies4(\pi-2)=R^2(\pi-2)\implies
        R=2.\]The answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        Since the two figures are similar, and the 4 regions in the first circle
        are equal in area to one of the four regions in the second circle, the
        second figure's area is $4$ times the first figure's area. Therefore,
        the side lengths are multiplied by a factor of $\sqrt{4} = 2$, so the
        answer is $1 \cdot 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)} 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 5</h3>
      <p>
        First find the area of the smaller circle with the known radius. Since
        the radius is $1$, the area of the circle is $\pi$, and finding the side
        length of the square would equal to $\sqrt{2}$. Squaring that gives us
        the area of the square which is $2$, and the shaded area of the first
        one is equal to $\pi - 2$. The second area can be shortened to
        $\frac{R^2\pi}{4} - \frac{\left(\sqrt{2R^2}\right)^2}{4}$, since we only
        need $\frac{1}{4}$th of the sections. We then make them equal, which
        makes this equation:<br />

        $\pi - 2 = \frac{R^2\pi}{4} - \frac{\left(\sqrt{2R^2}\right)^2}{4}$<br />

        Simplifying this equation would be $4\pi - 8 = R^2\pi - 2R^2$. We can
        factor out the $R^2$ which makes $4\pi - 8 = R^2\left(\pi - 2\right)$.
        Dividing out the $\pi - 2$ would give us $4$ on the left side. $4 = R^2$
        which leaves us to choice $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$.

      <h3>Solution 6</h3>
      <p>
        We are given two circles, each with an inscribed square. In the first
        circle, the radius is 1 unit, and the region between the circle and the
        inscribed square is shaded. In the second circle, one quarter of the
        region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. The shaded
        areas in both circles are the same. Our goal is to determine the radius
        $R$ of the second circle.<br />

        Step 1: Set up a ratio for the areas of the shaded regions We know that
        the shaded region in the first circle (with radius 1) and the shaded
        region in the second circle (with radius $R$) are proportional in terms
        of the total area between the circle and the inscribed square. The
        shaded area in the second circle is one quarter of the total area
        between the circle and the square, while the shaded area in the first
        circle is the entire region.<br />

        Step 2: Relate the areas to the radius<br />

        Let’s recall that the area between the circle and the inscribed square
        is proportional to the square of the radius of the circle because the
        square's side length scales with the radius of the circle.<br />

        So, in the first circle with radius 1:\[\text{Area between circle and
        square} \propto 1^2 = 1\]and the shaded area is proportional to the
        entire area between the circle and the square, i.e., 1.<br />

        In the second circle with radius $R$:\[\text{Area between circle and
        square} \propto R^2\]and the shaded area is one-quarter of this total
        area, so it is proportional to $\frac{1}{4} R^2$.<br />

        Step 3: Set up the ratio of shaded areas<br />

        We are told that the shaded areas in both circles are the same, so we
        set up the following equation:\[1 = \frac{1}{4} R^2\]<br />

        Step 4: Solve for $R$<br />

        Multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\[4 = R^2\]Taking the square
        root of both sides:\[R = 2\]<br />

        Thus, the radius of the second circle is $\boxed{\text{(B) 2}}$.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 7</h3>
      <p>
        Notice that if you shaded the rest of the region between the square and
        the circle, then the area would be $4$ times the area of the shaded
        region in the smaller circle. Since the radius changes by a factor of
        $k^2$, $k^2 = 4$, solving for gets you $2$. Hence, the answer is
        $\fbox{\textbf{(B)}\ 2}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 8</h3>
      <p>
        We want to find a quick and easy formula that can be applied to this
        (not necessarily a formula, but a rule). We take the area of the circle
        and subtract it from the area of the square and you will find the area
        of the $4$ outer shaded regions. This rule is basically $\pi
        r^2-2r^2=r^2(\pi-2)$. We plug in the radius from the first figure and
        compute the answer to be $\pi-2$. Since this represents the area of ONE
        region in the second figure, we have to multiply our result by four
        which gets us $4\pi-8$ or to make it easier, you can factor the four and
        make it $4(\pi-2)$. Using our rule, we can set both equations equal to
        each other.<br />

        $R^2(\pi-2)=4(\pi-2)$<br />

        $R^2=4$<br />

        $R=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}2}$

      <h2>Queston 19</h2>
      <p>
        Two towns, $A$ and $B$, are connected by a straight road, $15$ miles
        long. Traveling from town $A$ to town $B$, the speed limit changes every
        $5$ miles: from $25$ to $40$ to $20$ miles per hour (mph). Two cars, one
        at town $A$ and one at town $B$, start moving toward each other at the
        same time. They drive at exactly the speed limit in each portion of the
        road. How far from town $A$, in miles, will the two cars meet?

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        From the answer choices, the cars will meet somewhere along the $40$ mph
        stretch. Car $A$ travels $25$mph for $5$ miles, so we can use
        dimensional analysis to see that it will be $\frac{1\ \text{hr}}{25\
        \text{mi}}\cdot 5\ \text{mi} = \frac{1}{5}$ of an hour for this portion.
        Similarly, car $B$ spends $\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour on the $20$ mph
        portion.<br />

        Suppose that car $A$ travels $x$ miles along the $40$ mph portion-- then
        car $B$ travels $5-x$ miles along the $40$ mph portion. By identical
        methods, car $A$ travels for $\frac{1}{40}\cdot x = \frac{x}{40}$ hours,
        and car $B$ travels for $\frac{5-x}{40}$ hours.<br />

        At their meeting point, cars $A$ and $B$ will have traveled for the same
        amount of time, so we have\begin{align*} \frac{1}{5} + \frac{x}{40} &=
        \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5-x}{40}\\ 8 + x &= 10 + 5-x, \end{align*}so $2x =
        7$, and $x = 3.5$ miles. This means that car $A$ will have traveled $5 +
        3.5= \boxed{\textbf{(D)\ 8.5}}$ miles.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        The first car, moving from town $A$ at $25$ miles per hour, takes
        $\frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5} \text{hours} = 12$ minutes. The second car,
        traveling another $5$ miles from town $B$, takes $\frac{5}{20} =
        \frac{1}{4} \text{hours} = 15$ minutes. The first car has traveled for 3
        minutes or $\frac{1}{20}$th of an hour at $40$ miles per hour when the
        second car has traveled 5 miles. The first car has traveled $40 \cdot
        \frac{1}{20} = 2$ miles from the previous $5$ miles it traveled at $25$
        miles per hour. They have $3$ miles left, and they travel at the same
        speed, so they meet $1.5$ miles through, so they are $5 + 2 + 1.5 =
        \boxed{\textbf{(D) }8.5}$ miles from town $A$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of using algebra, we can visualize how far each car has traveled
        every hour. Let us divide each portion of the road into distances
        traveled each hour: For the $25$ mph portion, we divide it up into 5
        sections, because $\frac{25\ \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 5\ \text{hr}$.
        Similarly, we divide the $40$ mph portion into 8 sections ($\frac{40\
        \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 8\ \text{hr}$) and the $20$ mph portion into
        4 sections ($\frac{20\ \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 4\ \text{hr}$). Thus,
        we have the following diagram.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage1.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        After four hours, car A has reached the end of the $20$ mph portion,
        while car B has traveled $\frac{4}{5}$ of the $25$ mph portion. We can
        plot the amount of distance traveled, with the red dot representing car
        A and the blue dot representing car B.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage2.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        If we keep moving the dots, they will eventually meet at segment 3.5 of
        the $40$ mph portion of the road (note that each segment represents 1
        hour of time traveled):
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage3.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, we must account for the $5$ miles in the $25$ mph portion. Since
        the two cars meet at segment 3.5 of the $40$ mph portion, we add the $5$
        miles traveled in the $25$ mph section:<br />

        \[5\ \text{mi} + 3.5\ \text{mi} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) 8.5}}\]miles
