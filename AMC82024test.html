      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        We can rewrite the expression as $222,222-(22,222+2,222+222+22+2)$. We
        note that the units digit of $22,222+2,222+222+22+2$ is $0$ because all
        the units digits of the five numbers are $2$ and $5\cdot2=10$, which has
        a units digit of $0$. Now, we have something with a units digit of $0$
        subtracted from $222,222$, and so the units digit of this expression is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        \[222,222-22,222 = 200,000\]\[200,000 - 2,222 = 197778\]\[197778 - 222 =
        197556\]\[197556 - 22 = 197534\]\[197534 - 2 = 197532\]So our answer is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$. (Note that brute forcing takes lots of time
        and the AMC8 is a timed test)
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        We only care about the units digits. Thus, $2-2$ ends in $0$, $0-2$
        after regrouping(10-2) ends in $8$, $8-2$ ends in $6$, $6-2$ ends in
        $4$, and $4-2$ ends in $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        We just take the units digit of each and subtract, adding an extra ten
        to the first number so we don't get a negative
        number:\[(12-2)-(2+2+2+2)=10-8=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}\]
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 5</h3>
      <p>
        \[222{,}222-22{,}222-2{,}222-222-22-2\equiv2-2-2-2-2\equiv-8\equiv\boxed{\textbf{(B)
        } 2}\pmod{10}\]
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 6</h3>
      <p>
        We can ignore the other digits and just do $22-2-2-2-2-2$. Because you
        are subtracting five $2s$ and $2\cdot5 = 10$, you subtract $10$ from
        $22$. This gives us 12, so the last digit is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$.

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        We see that $\frac{44}{11}$ is $4$; $\frac{110}{44}$ simplifies to
        $\frac{5}{2}$, which is $2.5$;<br />

        and $\frac{44}{1100}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{25}$, which is $0.04$;<br />

        $4+2.5+0.04$ reveals\[\frac{44}{11} + \frac{110}{44} +
        \frac{44}{1100}\]is $\boxed{\text{(C) 6.54}}$.

        We work inwards. The area of the outer shaded square is the area of the
        whole square minus the area of the second largest square. The area of
        the inner shaded region is the area of the third largest square minus
        the area of the smallest square. The sum of these areas is<br />\[10^2 -

        $50$ people scored at least $80\%$, and out of these $50$ people, $13$
        of them earned a score that was not less than $90\%$, so the number of
        people that scored in between at least $80\%$ and less than $90\%$ is
        $50-13 = \boxed{\text{(D) 37}}$.

        Let $a$ denote the number of people who had a score of at least $85$,

        score of at least $80$ but less than $85$. Our answer is equal to $a+b$.
        We find $a = 27 - 13 = 14$, while $b = 50 - 27 = 23$. Thus, the answer

        Each of the $6$ faces of the cube have equal area, so the area of each
        face is equal to $\frac{18}{6} = 3$, making the side length $\sqrt3$.
        From this, we can see that the volume of the cube is $\sqrt{3}^3 =

      <p>
        Let the side length of the cube shown be equal to $s$ centimeters. The

        which is equal to $18$ square centimeters. The surface area of this cube
        is also $6s^2$ square centimeters, so we have\[6s^2 = 18 \implies s^2 =
        \frac{18}{6} = 3 \implies s = \sqrt{3}.\]However, we aren't done. We
        have found that the side length of the cube is $\sqrt{3} cm$, but the
        question asks for the volume of the cube, which is equal to $s^3 =

        \frac{6+12}{2}}{6} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}((1+7)+(2+8)+\cdots+(6+12))}{6} =

      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        We proceed with brute force. All of the pairs of opposite numbers on the
        clock are $(12,6)$, $(1,7)$, $(2,8)$, $(3,9)$, $(4,10)$, $(5,11)$, where
        order doesn't matter. The averages of each of these pairs are $9, 4, 5,
        6, 7,$ and $8$ respectively, and the average these numbers is
        $\frac{9+4+5+6+7+8}{6}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        The problem is asking for the average of all $12$ numbers. To find the
        average of all $12$ numbers, you find the sum of all the integers from
        $1$ to $12$ which is $78$, and divide it by $12$ because there are 12
        terms. Therefore, the answer is
        $\frac{78}{12}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$. You could also see that the
        average of, $2$ and $8$, is $5$, only one more that it's consecutive
        pair, $1$ and $7$ which is $4$. Assuming that this is the pattern, we
        can find the average $4$ to $9$ (6 consecutive integers starting with
        $4$), and we that find our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~6.5}$.

        The area of each rectangle is $5 \cdot 3 = 15$. Then the sum of the
        areas of the two regions is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles,
        minus the area of their overlap. To find the area of the overlap, we
        note that the region of overlap is a square, each of whose sides have
        length $2.5$ (as they are formed by the midpoint of one of the long
        sides, the vertex, and also, since it is rotated 90 degrees). Then the
        answer is $15+15-2.5^2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~23.75}$.

        As you can see, there is a hole in the top left corner of the board,
        which would be impossible to fill using the tetrominos. There are three
        cases in which a hole isn't created; the S lies flat in the bottom left
        corner, it lies flat in the top right corner, or it stands upright in
        the center. All three tilings are shown below.

        For each of the inverted cases, the L pieces can be inverted along with
        the S piece. Because the only cases that fill the rectangle after the S

        The largest circle that can fit inside the figure has its center in the

        the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from the center to one of these

        Draw the circle in the grid and analyze the radius. Its radius is a

        than 4π. So, the area of the circle is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 5\pi}$ with

        Let's take the numbers 2 through 14 (evens). The remainders will be 2,
        4, 6, 1, 3, 5, and 0. This sequence keeps repeating itself over and
        over. We can take $\left\lfloor\frac{50}{14}\right\rfloor$, so after the
        number 42, every remainder has been achieved 3 times. However, since 44,
        46, 48, and 50 are left, the remainders of those will be 2, 4, 6, and 1
        respectively. The only histogram in which those 4 numbers are set at 4
        is histogram $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Writing down all the remainders gives us $2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6,
        1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1.$ In this list, there are
        $3$ numbers with remainder $0$, $4$ numbers with remainder $1$, $4$
        numbers with remainder $2$, $3$ numbers with remainder $3$, $4$ numbers
        with remainder $4$, $3$ numbers with remainder $5$, and $4$ numbers with
        remainder $6$. Manually computation of every single term can be avoided
        by recognizing the pattern alternates from $0, 2, 4, 6$ to $1, 3, 5$ and
        there are $25$ terms. The only histogram that matches this is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.

        The median of the list is $7$, so the mean of the new list will be $7
        \cdot 2 = 14$. Since there are $6$ numbers in the new list, the sum of
        the $6$ numbers will be $14 \cdot 6 = 84$. Therefore, $2+6+7+7+28+N = 84
        \implies N = \boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Since the average right now is $10$, and the median is $7$, we see that
        $N$ must be larger than $10$, which means that the median of the 6
        resulting numbers should be $7$, making the mean of these $14$. We can
        do $2 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 28 + N = 14 * 6 = 84$. $50 + N = 84$, so $N$ =
        $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        We try out every option by inserting each number into the list. After
        trying out each number, we get $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this is very time-consuming and it is not the most practical
        solution.

      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        We could use answer choices to solve this problem. The sum of the $5$
        numbers is $50$. If you add $7$ to the list, $57$ is not divisible by
        $6$, therefore it will not work. Same thing applies to $14$ and $20$.
        The only possible choices left are $28$ and $34$. Now you check $28$.
        You see that $28$ doesn't work because $(28+50) \div 6 = 13$ and $13$ is
        not twice of the median, which is still $7$. Therefore, only choice left
        is $\boxed{\text{(E) 34}}$

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        First, we note that there are $18$ "pairs" of squares folded on top of
        each other after the folding. The minimum number of gold pairs occurs
        when silver squares occupy the maximum number of pairs, and the maximum
        number of gold pairs occurs when silver squares occupy the minimum
        number of pairs. The latter case occurs when all $13$ silver squares are
        placed in different pairs, resulting in $18-13=5$ gold pairs. The former
        case occurs when the silver squares are paired up as much as possible,
        resulting in $6$ complete pairs and another square occupying another
        pair slot. Then there are $18-7=11$ gold pairs. Our answer is
        $11+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        We can see that the least number of gold-on-gold pairs will be obtained
        when the $13$ silver squares are placed on the two sides so that they
        don't overlap when folded over (because then it will minimize the number
        of gold-on-golds). We can see that if we split them up $6$ and $7$ on
        both sides, and then fold it, the number of gold-on-golds will be $18-13
        = 5$.
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum number of gold-on-golds will be achieved when the silver
        squares overlap when folded over, which will increase the number of
        gold-on-golds. If we align 6 silver squares with each other on each
        side, and put the last one somewhere else, we get the maximum is $18 - 7
        = 11$. Therefore, the answer is $11+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~16}$.

      <p>
        Note that for no two numbers to differ by $10$, every number chosen must
        have a different units digit. To make computations easier, we can choose
        $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ from the first group and $(16, 17, 18, 19, 20)$ from
        the second group. Then the sum evaluates to $1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20 =
        \boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        For $1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20$, we can add the first term and the last
        term, which is $21$. If we add the second term and the second-to-last
        term it is also $21$. There are $5$ pairs that sum to $21$, so the
        answer is $21 \times 5$ which equals $\boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        One efficient method is to quickly add $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
        10)$, which is $55$. Then because you took $50$ in total away from $(16,
        17, 18, 19, 20)$, you add $50$. $55+50= \boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.

      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I started with the easiest/smallest case
        possible. In my opinion, that was
        <br />$1+2+3+4+5+16+17+18+19+20$.<br />
        I then solved this equation quickly using Little Gauss's method,
        rearranging that into <br />$1+19+2+18+3+17+4+16+5+20$.<br />
        I simplified this into <br />$20+20+20+20+25$.<br />
        Solving this simple equation gives us the answer, which is
        $\boxed{\text{(C)\ 105}}$.

        We could also make an equation. Let's denote the number of people that
        live in city $A$ as $a$, $B$ as $b$, and $C$ as $c$. If $x$ denotes the
        number of people working in city $A$, then $x = \frac{1}{8}c +
        \frac{1}{3}b + a - \frac{1}{4}a - \frac{1}{5}a$. This is because
        $\frac{1}{8}$ of the people from City $C$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ of the
        people from City $B$ work in city $A$ as shown in the image. We also
        know that $\frac{9}{20}$ of the people living in $A$ work in other
        cities. We are already given the values of variables $a$, $b$, and $c$
        as $100$, $120$, and $160$ respectively. Plug the values it into the

        $x = 160 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 120 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 100 - 100 \cdot

        The area of the shaded region in the circle on the left is the area of
        the circle minus the area of the square, or $\big(\pi-2)$. The shaded
        area in the circle on the right is $\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the area of the
        circle minus the area of the square, or $\dfrac{\pi R^2-2R^2}{4}$, which
        can be factored as $\dfrac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$. Since the shaded areas are
        equal to each other, we have $\pi-2=\dfrac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$, which
        simplifies to $R^2=4$. Taking the square root, we have
        $R=\boxed{\text{(B)\ 2}}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        The side length of the smaller square is $\sqrt{2}$, which follows from
        the Pythagorean Theorem since the square is inscribed in a circle of
        radius $1$, making the diagonal equal to $2$. Thus, the area of the
        square is $(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$. The circle in which the square is
        inscribed has radius $1$, so its area is $\pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi$.
        Therefore, the area of the shaded region (the part of the circle not
        covered by the square) is $\pi - 2$.<br />

        Now, consider the larger square, which is inscribed in a circle of
        radius $R$. This square can be divided into four congruent right
        triangles by drawing lines from the center of the circle to the vertices
        of the square. Each triangle has legs of length $R$ and includes a
        $90^\circ$ angle at the center. Using the triangle area formula
        $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C)$ with $a = b = R$ and $C = 90^\circ$, each
        triangle has area $\frac{1}{2}R^2$. Since there are four such triangles,
        the area of the square is $4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}R^2 = 2R^2$. The area of
        the circle is $\pi R^2$, so the area of the shaded region (the part of
        the circle outside the square) is $\frac{1}{4}(\pi R^2 - 2R^2) =
        \frac{1}{4}R^2(\pi - 2)$.<br />

        We are told that this shaded region also has area equal to $\pi - 2$, so
        we set up the equation $\frac{1}{4}R^2(\pi - 2) = \pi - 2$. Assuming
        $\pi - 2 \neq 0$, we divide both sides by $\pi - 2$, giving
        $\frac{1}{4}R^2 = 1$, which leads to $R^2 = 4$, and finally $R = 2$.
        Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) } 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        We start with the first area. Since the square is inscribed, its
        diagonal is $2\implies$ its side length is $\sqrt{2}\implies$ its area
        is $2$, therefore the first area is $\pi-2$. The second area is
        $\dfrac{R^2\pi-2R^2}{4}$, found in a similar manner. Writing and solving
        the equation, we
        have\[\pi-2=\dfrac{R^2\pi-2R^2}{4}\implies4(\pi-2)=R^2(\pi-2)\implies
        R=2.\]The answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        Since the two figures are similar, and the 4 regions in the first circle
        are equal in area to one of the four regions in the second circle, the
        second figure's area is $4$ times the first figure's area. Therefore,
        the side lengths are multiplied by a factor of $\sqrt{4} = 2$, so the
        answer is $1 \cdot 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)} 2}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 5</h3>
      <p>
        First find the area of the smaller circle with the known radius. Since
        the radius is $1$, the area of the circle is $\pi$, and finding the side
        length of the square would equal to $\sqrt{2}$. Squaring that gives us
        the area of the square which is $2$, and the shaded area of the first
        one is equal to $\pi - 2$. The second area can be shortened to
        $\frac{R^2\pi}{4} - \frac{\left(\sqrt{2R^2}\right)^2}{4}$, since we only
        need $\frac{1}{4}$th of the sections. We then make them equal, which
        makes this equation:<br />

        $\pi - 2 = \frac{R^2\pi}{4} - \frac{\left(\sqrt{2R^2}\right)^2}{4}$<br />

        Simplifying this equation would be $4\pi - 8 = R^2\pi - 2R^2$. We can
        factor out the $R^2$ which makes $4\pi - 8 = R^2\left(\pi - 2\right)$.
        Dividing out the $\pi - 2$ would give us $4$ on the left side. $4 = R^2$
        which leaves us to choice $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$.

      <h3>Solution 6</h3>
      <p>
        We are given two circles, each with an inscribed square. In the first
        circle, the radius is 1 unit, and the region between the circle and the
        inscribed square is shaded. In the second circle, one quarter of the
        region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. The shaded
        areas in both circles are the same. Our goal is to determine the radius
        $R$ of the second circle.<br />

        Step 1: Set up a ratio for the areas of the shaded regions We know that
        the shaded region in the first circle (with radius 1) and the shaded
        region in the second circle (with radius $R$) are proportional in terms
        of the total area between the circle and the inscribed square. The
        shaded area in the second circle is one quarter of the total area
        between the circle and the square, while the shaded area in the first
        circle is the entire region.<br />

        Step 2: Relate the areas to the radius<br />

        Let’s recall that the area between the circle and the inscribed square
        is proportional to the square of the radius of the circle because the
        square's side length scales with the radius of the circle.<br />

        So, in the first circle with radius 1:\[\text{Area between circle and
        square} \propto 1^2 = 1\]and the shaded area is proportional to the
        entire area between the circle and the square, i.e., 1.<br />

        In the second circle with radius $R$:\[\text{Area between circle and
        square} \propto R^2\]and the shaded area is one-quarter of this total
        area, so it is proportional to $\frac{1}{4} R^2$.<br />

        Step 3: Set up the ratio of shaded areas<br />

        We are told that the shaded areas in both circles are the same, so we
        set up the following equation:\[1 = \frac{1}{4} R^2\]<br />

        Step 4: Solve for $R$<br />

        Multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\[4 = R^2\]Taking the square
        root of both sides:\[R = 2\]<br />

        Thus, the radius of the second circle is $\boxed{\text{(B) 2}}$.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 7</h3>
      <p>
        Notice that if you shaded the rest of the region between the square and
        the circle, then the area would be $4$ times the area of the shaded
        region in the smaller circle. Since the radius changes by a factor of
        $k^2$, $k^2 = 4$, solving for gets you $2$. Hence, the answer is
        $\fbox{\textbf{(B)}\ 2}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 8</h3>
      <p>
        We want to find a quick and easy formula that can be applied to this
        (not necessarily a formula, but a rule). We take the area of the circle
        and subtract it from the area of the square and you will find the area
        of the $4$ outer shaded regions. This rule is basically $\pi
        r^2-2r^2=r^2(\pi-2)$. We plug in the radius from the first figure and
        compute the answer to be $\pi-2$. Since this represents the area of ONE
        region in the second figure, we have to multiply our result by four
        which gets us $4\pi-8$ or to make it easier, you can factor the four and
        make it $4(\pi-2)$. Using our rule, we can set both equations equal to
        each other.<br />

        $R^2(\pi-2)=4(\pi-2)$<br />

        $R^2=4$<br />

        $R=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}2}$

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        From the answer choices, the cars will meet somewhere along the $40$ mph
        stretch. Car $A$ travels $25$mph for $5$ miles, so we can use
        dimensional analysis to see that it will be $\frac{1\ \text{hr}}{25\
        \text{mi}}\cdot 5\ \text{mi} = \frac{1}{5}$ of an hour for this portion.
        Similarly, car $B$ spends $\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour on the $20$ mph
        portion.<br />

        Suppose that car $A$ travels $x$ miles along the $40$ mph portion-- then
        car $B$ travels $5-x$ miles along the $40$ mph portion. By identical
        methods, car $A$ travels for $\frac{1}{40}\cdot x = \frac{x}{40}$ hours,
        and car $B$ travels for $\frac{5-x}{40}$ hours.<br />

        At their meeting point, cars $A$ and $B$ will have traveled for the same
        amount of time, so we have\begin{align*} \frac{1}{5} + \frac{x}{40} &=
        \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5-x}{40}\\ 8 + x &= 10 + 5-x, \end{align*}so $2x =
        7$, and $x = 3.5$ miles. This means that car $A$ will have traveled $5 +
        3.5= \boxed{\textbf{(D)\ 8.5}}$ miles.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        The first car, moving from town $A$ at $25$ miles per hour, takes
        $\frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5} \text{hours} = 12$ minutes. The second car,
        traveling another $5$ miles from town $B$, takes $\frac{5}{20} =
        \frac{1}{4} \text{hours} = 15$ minutes. The first car has traveled for 3
        minutes or $\frac{1}{20}$th of an hour at $40$ miles per hour when the
        second car has traveled 5 miles. The first car has traveled $40 \cdot
        \frac{1}{20} = 2$ miles from the previous $5$ miles it traveled at $25$
        miles per hour. They have $3$ miles left, and they travel at the same
        speed, so they meet $1.5$ miles through, so they are $5 + 2 + 1.5 =
        \boxed{\textbf{(D) }8.5}$ miles from town $A$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of using algebra, we can visualize how far each car has traveled
        every hour. Let us divide each portion of the road into distances
        traveled each hour: For the $25$ mph portion, we divide it up into 5
        sections, because $\frac{25\ \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 5\ \text{hr}$.
        Similarly, we divide the $40$ mph portion into 8 sections ($\frac{40\
        \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 8\ \text{hr}$) and the $20$ mph portion into
        4 sections ($\frac{20\ \text{mph}}{5\ \text{mi}} = 4\ \text{hr}$). Thus,
        we have the following diagram.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage1.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        After four hours, car A has reached the end of the $20$ mph portion,
        while car B has traveled $\frac{4}{5}$ of the $25$ mph portion. We can
        plot the amount of distance traveled, with the red dot representing car
        A and the blue dot representing car B.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage2.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        If we keep moving the dots, they will eventually meet at segment 3.5 of
        the $40$ mph portion of the road (note that each segment represents 1
        hour of time traveled):
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="./Assets/Images/Q19SolImage3.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, we must account for the $5$ miles in the $25$ mph portion. Since
        the two cars meet at segment 3.5 of the $40$ mph portion, we add the $5$
        miles traveled in the $25$ mph section:<br />

        \[5\ \text{mi} + 3.5\ \text{mi} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) 8.5}}\]miles

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        Let the total amount of cheese be $1$. We will track the amount of
        cheese Sarika eats throughout the process.<br />

        First Round: Sarika eats half of the total cheese, so she
        eats:\[\frac{1}{2}.\]Second Round: Dev eats half of what remains after
        Sarika's turn, which is:\[\frac{1}{4}.\]Third Round: Rajiv eats half of
        the remaining cheese after Dev’s turn, which is:\[\frac{1}{8}.\]<br />

        At the end of the first round, the total cheese eaten is:\[\frac{1}{2} +
        \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}.\]<br />

        We observe that Sarika’s consumption follows a geometric sequence. In
        the first round, she eats $\frac{1}{2}$, and in subsequent rounds, she
        eats half of what remains from the previous round. This gives the
        following series for Sarika’s total consumption:<br />

        \[\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{128} + \cdots\]<br />

        This is a geometric series with first term $\frac{1}{2}$ and common
        ratio $\frac{1}{8}$. The sum $S$ of this infinite geometric series is
        given by the formula:<br />

        \[S = \frac{a}{1 - r},\]where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the
        common ratio. Substituting $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $r = \frac{1}{8}$:<br />

        \[S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{8}} =
        \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{7}{8}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{7} =
        \frac{4}{7}.\]<br />

        Thus, Sarika eats $\frac{4}{7}$ of the original block of cheese. The
        correct answer is:\[\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{4}{7}}.\]<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Sarika eats $1/2$ of the original cheese, and then because the others
        eat $1/4$ and $1/8$, she eats $1/16$ next, and then $1/128$, and then so
        on. Since the values later are going to be too small to make a huge
        difference, we can use these $3$ values. She ate $(64 + 8 + 1)/128 =
        73/128$. We can replace the $73$ with a $72$ for now, so $72/128 =
        9/16$, which simplifies to around $56.25$. Since there is a little bit
        more of the cheese to be accounted for, the amount that she eats will be
        around $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{4}{7}}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Her first $2$ bites will be $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{16}$. Everything
        else won't matter, so the answer will be closest to $\frac{9}{16}$,
        $\frac{4}{7}$.

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        The key observation for this solution is to observe that pods $C$ and
        $F$ both have degree 5; that is, they are connected to five other pods.
        This implies that $C$ and $F$ must contain grades 1 and 7 in either
        order (if $C$ or $F$ contained any of grades 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then
        there would only be four possible grades for five pods, a
        contradiction). It does not matter which grade $C$ and $F$ gets (see
        Solution 2 below), so we will assume that pod $C$ is assigned grade 1,
        and pod $F$ is assigned grade 7.<br />

        Next, pod $D$ is the only pod which is not adjacent to pod $F$, so pod
        $D$ must be assigned grade 6. Similarly, pod $G$ must be assigned grade
        2.<br />

        Lastly, we need to assign grades 3, 4, and 5 to pods $A$, $B$, and $E$.
        Note that $A$ and $B$ are adjacent; therefore, pods $A$ and $B$ must
        contain grades 3 and 5. We conclude that $E$ must be assigned grade 4.
        The requested sum is $1+4+7 = \mathbf{(A)\,} 12$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose that we replaced each label $x$ with $8-x$. That is, we replaced
        the grade $a$ assigned to $A$ with the grade $8-a$, the grade $b$
        assigned to $B$ with $8-b$, and so on. We claim that if the initial
        labeling is valid (i.e., each pair of connected pods has grades
        differing by 2 or more), then so will the new labeling. This follows as
        if $|x-y| \ge 2$, then $|(8-x)-(8-y)|=|-x+y| = |x-y| \ge 2$. This shows
        that if there is an assignment $(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)$ of grades to the pods,
        where $\{a,b,\ldots,g\} = \{1,2,\ldots,7\}$, then there is a second,
        valid assignment.<br />

        But because this is an AMC 8 problem and there is only one correct
        answer, we can conclude that $c+e+f = (8-c)+(8-e)+(8-f)$. Simplifying
        and solving for $c+e+f$ gives $c+e+f = \mathbf{(A)\,} 12$.

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose there are $c$ coats on the rack. Notice that there are $c+1$
        "gaps" formed by these coats, each of which must have the same number of
        empty spaces (say, $k$). Then the values $k$ and $c$ must satisfy
        $(c+k)(c+1)=35 \implies kc+k+c=35$. We now use Simon's Favorite
        Factoring Trick as follows:\[kc+k+c=35\]\<br />[\implies
        kc+k+c+1=36\]\<br />[\implies (k+1)(c+1)=36\]<br />Our only restrictions
        now are that $k>0 \implies k+1 > 1$ and $c>0 \implies c+1>1$. Other than
        that, each factor pair of $36$ produces a valid solution $(k,c)$, which
        in turn uniquely determines an arrangement. Since $36$ has $9$ factors,
        our answer is $9-2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~7}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Say Paulina placed $n$ coats. That will divide the 35 hooks into $n+1$
        spaces and $35-n$ empty hooks. Therefore,<br />\[n+1|35-n.\]<br />The
        values of $n$ that satisfy this are\[n\in{1,2,3,5,8,11,17}\]<br />The
        answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) }7}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Let the number of empty hooks before the first coat be denoted as
        $n$.<br />

        This means that there are $n$ empty hooks between all the coats. In
        every situation, there are $n + 1$ gaps, since $n$ cannot be zero.<br />

        To solve the problem, subtract $2n$ from 35 (accounting for the $n$
        empty hooks at the beginning and $n$ empty hooks at the end). Then
        subtract 1 (for the first occupied hook). After that, divide the
        remaining number of hooks by $n + 1$ (the number of hooks between
        coats). We do this because the first occupied hook is always after $n$
        hooks; we just need to check if the remaining hooks can be evenly
        divided by the number of gaps.<br />

        To clarify:<br />

        If $n = 1$: \begin{align*} 35 - 2n &= 33 \\ 33 - 1 &= 32 \\ \frac{32}{n
        + 1} &= 16 \end{align*}<br />
        Since 16 is an integer, this situation satisfies the conditions.<br />

        If $n = 2$:<br />
        We can skip the the third step, as each time you add 1 to $n$, it
        decreases by 2 from the previous situation.<br />

        \[\frac{30}{n + 1} = 16\]<br />

        This situation also satisfies the conditions.<br />

        Continue this process until the difference exceeds $35 - (2n + 1)$. We
        find that 7 situations satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the answer is
        7.<br />

        Note: This method is slow but easy to check and understand.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose there are $n$ occupied hooks on the rack. Observe that there are
        $n+1$ intervals, each of which must have the same number of empty hooks.
        Let's suppose $m$ is the number of empty hooks plus the occupied hook to
        its right. Then, we have the equation<br />\[(n+1)m-1=35\]\<br />[\implies
        (n+1)m=36\]<br />Our restrictions are n > 0 and m > 1. 36 has 9 factors,
        and two pairs do not meet the restriction. Our answer is then
        $9-2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~7}$.

        The Condition (II) perfect square must end in "$00$" because
        $...99+1=...00$ Condition (I). Four-digit perfect squares ending in
        "$00$" are ${40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}$.<br />

        Condition (II) also says the number is in the form $n^2-1$. By the

      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>
        Let $a$ be the length of the shorter base, and let $b$ be the length of
        the longer one. Note that these two parameters, along with the angle
        measures and the fact that the trapezoid is isosceles, uniquely
        determine a trapezoid. We drop perpendiculars down from the endpoints of
        the top base. Then the length from the foot of this perpendicular to
        either vertex will be half the difference between the lengths of the two
        bases, or $\frac{b-a}{2}$. Now, since we have a 30-60-90 triangle and
        this side length corresponds to the "30" part, the length of the
        hypotenuse (one of the legs) is $2 \cdot \frac{b-a}{2} = b-a$. Then the
        perimeter of the trapezoid is $2(b-a)+a+b=3b-a=30$. The only other
        stipulation for this trapezoid to be valid is that $b>a$ (which was our
        assumption). We can now easily count the valid pairs $(a,b)$, yielding
        $(3,11),(6,12),(9,13),(12,14)$. It is clear that proceeding further
        would cause $a \geq b$, so we have $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4}$ valid
        trapezoids.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Let $x$ be the length of $AB$ and $DC$, and let $b$ be the length of the
        shorter base. Because $\angle B$ and $\angle C = 60^{\circ}$, the length
        of the longer base is $b + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = b + x$.
        Therefore, the perimeter is $3x + 2b = 30$. The number of positive
        integer pairs $(x, b)$ is $(2,12), (4,9), (6,6), (8,3)$, meaning the
        answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4}$.<br />

        way where you don't have to test pairs:<br />

        We can rearrange $3x + 2b = 30$ to $\frac{30-3x}{2} = b$. We want
        $\frac{30-3x}{2}$ to be a positive integer so b is a positive integer.
        30 is a multiple of 3 and $-3x$ is just subtracting multiples of 3's
        from 30 so every number on the numerator of $\frac{30-3x}{2}$ is a
        multiple of 3 under 30 ($x$ is also a positive integer so it can't be
        larger than 30 or not be a multiple of 3). For $30-3x$ to be divisible
        by 2 it must be even, so we are finding even multiples of 3 under 30
        which are 24, 18, 12, and 6. Each number will give us a valid $x$ and a
        valid $b$ pair giving us 4 solutions.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        Let $x$ be the length of the legs of the trapezoid. Draw the angle
        bisectors of the 120 degree angles. Now you have 2 equilateral
        triangles, and another figure in between them. Let $x+a$ be the length
        of the shorter base of the trapezoid, and let $2x+a$ be the length of
        the longer base. Since the perimeter of the trapezoid is 30, $5x+2a =
        30$. Since $x>$0, and $a$ can be negative as long as $x+a>0$, you get 4
        solutions for $(x,a)$, namely $(2,10), (4,5), (6,0), (8,-5)$. Any
        solution with $x\ge10$ would lead to $x+a\le0$. Hence, the answer is
        $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        Drop altitudes from angle $A$ and angle $D$. Then, two $30-60-90$
        triangles and a rectangle are created. Let the hypotenuse of both of the
        triangles equal $x$ and let side $AD$ equal $y$. Then, the distance from
        $B$ and $C$ to the feet of the altitudes that are closest to them is
        $\frac{x}{2}$, and the distance between the feet of the two altitudes
        would be $y$. The rest is similar to Solution 2
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 5</h3>
      <p>
        We give lengths to the base of the $30-60-90$ triangles on both sides as
        the trapezoid as variable $x$. We give lengths of Line $AB$ and the
        other side as variable $y$. When we add them, we have $6x+2y=30$ from
        the sides. If we lext $x=5$, the other sides won't work so it has to be
        integers less than $5$ which is $4$ which is the answer.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 6</h3>
      <p>
        Explanations and Reasoning to Similar Solutions<br />

        Note that trapezoid $ABCD$ is isosceles with $B$ and $C$ being the
        bottom 2 vertices. The shape can be dissected into 3 shapes with 2
        congruent right triangles separated by a rectangle. This is done by
        dropping an altitude, a perpendicular point on the base from each of the
        2 top vertices, named $E$ and $F$, respectively below $A$ and $D$. The
        property that angles $\angle$$B$ and $\angle$$C$ measure $60^\circ$ is
        significant here, forming $30-60-90$ triangles ($\triangle$$ABE$ and
        $\triangle$$DCF$). Now the assumed larger $^a$ side $BC$ is separated
        into 3 sections by the 3 shapes. Or $BC = BE + EF + CF$. $^b$ Recall
        that $\triangle$$ABE$ and $\triangle$$DCF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles, the
        side length ratios are $1:\sqrt3:2$. Naming the length of the shorter
        side of the right triangles as $a$, and the length of side $AD$ as $b$,
        then the trapezoid's side lengths can be expressed in only 2 variables.
        Now knowing $AD = b$, $DC = 2a$ $^c$, $BC = a + b + a = 2a + b$, and $AC
        = 2a$, the perimeter is $b + 2a + 2a + b + 2a = 2b + 6a = 30$.
        Simplifying, $3a + b = 15$, only 4 pairs of values satisfy this
        condition, namely $(1,12)$, $(2,9)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,3)$.<br />

        Thus there $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4}$ possible non-congruent
        trapezoids.<br />

        $^a$ The question asks for non-congruent trapezoids, and rotation
        preserves congruence so the assumption is always true WLOG.<br />

        $^b$ The shortest side of $\triangle$ABE, the length of AD (shape ADFE
        is a rectangle so FE = AD), and the shortest side of $\triangle$DCF.<br />

        $^c$ $AB = DC = 2a$, $AB$ and $DC$ are the hypotenuse of triangles
        $\triangle$ABE and $\triangle$DCF.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 7</h3>
      <p>
        Let $a = AD$ and $s = AB = DC$. Draw a segment from $A$ to
        $\overline{BC}$ parallel to $\overline{DC}$, meeting $\overline{BC}$ at
        point $P$, forming parallelogram $ADCP$. It follows that $AP = DC = s$
        and $PC = AD = a$. Isosceles $\triangle ABP$ has base angles measuring
        $60^\circ$, so it is equilateral and $BP = s$.<br />

        [asy] size(8cm); draw((-6, 0)--(6, 0)--(3, 3sqrt(3))--(-3,
        3sqrt(3))--cycle); draw((0, 0)--(-3, 3sqrt(3))--cycle); label("$P$", (0,
        0), S); label("$B$", (-6, 0), SW); label("$C$", (6, 0), SE);
        label("$A$", (-3, 3sqrt(3)), NW); label("$D$", (3, 3sqrt(3)), NE);
        label("$a$", (0, 3sqrt(3)), N); label("$a$", (3, 0), S); label("$s$",
        (-3, 0), S); label("$s$", (-4.5, 3sqrt(3)/2), W); label("$s$", (-1.5,
        3sqrt(3)/2), E); label("$s$", (4.5, 3sqrt(3)/2), E);
        label("$60^{\circ}$", (-5.75, 0), NE); label("$60^{\circ}$", (-0.25, 0),
        NW); label("$60^{\circ}$", (5.75, 0), NW); [/asy]<br />

        Then the perimeter of $ABCD$ is $L = 2a + 3s = 30$. To satisfy this
        equation with positive integer values, the number $a$ must be divisible
        by $3$ because $2a = 3(10 - s)$. The only possible values for $a$ are
        $3, 6, 9,$ and $12$, each value corresponding to a different trapezoid.
        Greater multiples of $3$ will not lead to a positive integer value for
        $s$. Therefore there are $\boxed{4}$ different trapezoids that satisfy
        the conditions.<br />

        The table below lists the side lengths $a$, $s$, and $a + s$ for these
        $4$ trapezoids, along with their perimeters.<br />
        $\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} a & s & a + s & L = 2a + 3s \\ \hline 3 & 8 & 11
        & 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 8 = 30 \\ 6 & 6 & 12 & 2 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 6 = 30
        \\ 9 & 4 & 13 & 2 \cdot 9 + 3 \cdot 4 = 30 \\ 12 & 2 & 14 & 2 \cdot 12 +
        3 \cdot 2 = 30 \\ \end{array}$
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 8</h3>
      <p>
        We can draw altitudes from A and B and create a rectangle and $2$
        $30-60-90$ triangles. Two sides of each triangle are on the trapezoid.
        We can label each of the hypotenuses of the small $30-60-90$ triangles
        as $2a$ and each of the short sides of the triangles as $a$. Then, the
        perimeter of the trapezoid becomes $2(2a + a) +$ a positive integer
        (we'll call this integer $n$) $= 30$. Simplifying, we get $6a + n = 30$,
        and since $n$ is not 0, $a$ must be a positive integer less than $5$,
        which yields $\boxed{4}$ options: $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.

      <p>
        If we test this problem on a smaller $2 \times 2$ diamond, we have $6$
        ways to go from $A$ to $B$, and the total area is $0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4
        = 12$, so the average area is $\frac{12}{6} = 2$, which is also the area
        of the diamond $2 \times 2 = 4$ divided by 2. If we assume this is true
        for a $5 \times 5$ diamond, then the average area is $\frac{25}{2}$. The
        number of paths from $A$ to $B$ is $\binom{10}{5} = 252$, and $252 \cdot
        \frac{25}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}~3150}$.

      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <p>
        Most other solutions don't explain how they got all the cases, as well
        as require an insight that's somewhat hard to think of, so I'll explain
        another in detail.<br />
        If we rotate the grid $45$ degrees clockwise we can have a 5x5 grid
        where we can move up and right. There can only be one horizontal line
        segment in each column at a certain y coordinate. We'll denote the y
        coordinates as $0,1,2,3,4,5$. Once we choose the y coordinates for each
        column, we have a unique path. However, we can't move down which means
        that columns cannot have a higher y coordinate than the ones to the
        right. This is the same as distributing 5 balls in six boxes labeled
        $0,1,2,3,4,5$. For example, if we get 2 in 0, 2 in 1, and 1 in 4, then
        the order would be $0,0,1,1,4$. This is one unique path, and the total
        number of paths is represented by 6+5-1 choose 6-1 = 252. Also, the sum
        of the y-coordinates represents the area, which means we want the
        average sum of the y-coordinates. This is $5*(0+5)/2 = 25/2$, and $25/2
        * 252 = \fbox{3150}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>
        As found, there are $252$ total paths. However, we can take advantage of
        symmetry here. We consider the total area of the left side of the grid
        in each of the $252$ paths. Since the total area of the left side of the
        grid in each of the $252$ paths is equal to the total area of the right
        side of the grid in each of the $252$ paths, and the two total areas sum
        to $(252)(25) = 6300$, then the total area of the right side of the grid
        is $6300/2 = \fbox{3150}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 4</h3>
      <p>
        q-analog basic definitions are for $k\in\mathbb{N}$, then<br />\[[k]_q=1+q+\cdots+q^{k-1}\]with\[[0]_q=1\]<br />The
        q-factorial of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is defined as<br />\[[n]!_q=[n]_q\cdot[n-1]_q\cdots[0]_q\]<br />The
        q-binomial theorem states<br />\[\binom{n}{k}_q=\frac{[n]!_q}{[k]!_q[n-k]!_q}\]<br />and
        finally for q-analog of lattice paths aka q-lattice path, we have the
        q-lattice path theorem which states for any $a, b\in\mathbb{N}$,<br />\[\sum_{P\in
        L(a,b)}q^{\text{area}(P)}=\binom{a+b}{a}_q\]<br />To get the sum of the
        areas we have to differentiate the q-Lattice Path and evaluate at $q=1$.
        For this problem our lattice path is $L(5,5)$ and we calculate the
        $q$-binomial as
        $q^{25}+q^{24}+2q^{23}+3q^{22}+5q^{21}+7q^{20}+9q^{19}+\cdots$ and take
        the derivative $\left.\frac{d}{dq}\binom{10}{5}_q\right|_{q=1}$ to get
        $25q^{24}+24q^{23}+46q^{22}+66q^{21}+105q^{20}+140q^{19}+171q^{18}+\cdots$
        and then plug in the 1 to finally get $\fbox{3150}$
